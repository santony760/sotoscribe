# SotoScribe Security Analysis

## In-Memory Only Implementation

SotoScribe has been designed with a strict "zero-storage" policy. All workflow data remains exclusively in memory until the user explicitly exports it. This approach ensures:

1. **No Data Persistence**: All captured data is held in volatile memory and is automatically wiped when:
   - The browser is closed
   - The tab is closed
   - The user exports the workflow 
   - The user cancels the workflow capture

2. **No External Transmission**: The extension never transmits data to external servers as:
   - All processing occurs locally within the browser context
   - No cloud APIs or telemetry are used
   - No dependencies fetch remote code at runtime

## Security Mechanisms

### Data Isolation
- All workflow data exists solely in the background service worker's memory space
- The extension uses message passing for communication between components
- No data is stored in localStorage, IndexedDB, or cookies

### Privacy Protection
- PII detection and masking for form inputs (emails, IDs, etc.)
- Automatic redaction patterns for sensitive data
- Manual image editing tools allow users to blur sensitive information

### Minimal Permissions
- Uses only required permissions: `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `tabs` 
- No unnecessary host permissions
- No persistent background page

### Export Controls
- Only allows PDF exports (processed entirely locally)
- SharePoint embed option generates code snippets without external dependencies
- No cloud upload/sync mechanisms

## Security-First Design Decisions

1. **Memory-Only State Management**
   - All workflow state is managed in the background script's memory
   - Each tab session maintains isolated data
   - Editor tab closure triggers complete data wiping

2. **User-Controlled Export**
   - PDF generation happens entirely client-side
   - Export action explicitly triggers data clearing
   - No automatic syncing or uploading

3. **Masking of Sensitive Data**
   - Input fields are analyzed for potential PII patterns
   - Automatic masking of emails, IDs, and passwords
   - Additional manual image editing for sensitive screenshot regions

4. **Clean Code Separation**
   - Modular design with clear component boundaries
   - No obfuscation or minification
   - Fully auditable codebase

## Security Limitations and Mitigations

1. **Screenshot Data**
   - **Risk**: Screenshots may contain sensitive information
   - **Mitigation**: Image editing tools allow user-controlled blurring
  
2. **DOM Access**
   - **Risk**: Content script has access to page DOM
   - **Mitigation**: Only captures explicit user actions, no background scanning

3. **Memory Persistence**
   - **Risk**: Browser crash could potentially leave memory uncleared
   - **Mitigation**: Browser's own memory management will clear this on restart

4. **Cross-Origin Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Cannot capture workflows across domains
   - **Mitigation**: Clear user notification when domain changes

## Audit Readiness

SotoScribe is designed to be audit-ready for highly regulated environments:

1. **Transparent Code**: No hidden functionality or obfuscation
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: No third-party libraries with unknown behaviors
3. **Explicit User Control**: All data capture and export is user-initiated
4. **Verifiable Behavior**: Extension's actions match its declared functionality
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of all data practices

## Compliance Considerations

The extension is designed to meet requirements for:

- **Government Environments**: Meeting zero-data-at-rest policies
- **Healthcare**: Supporting HIPAA compliance needs
- **Financial Services**: Meeting data protection requirements
- **Legal Services**: Providing auditable documentation workflows

By operating entirely in-memory and with user-controlled exports, SotoScribe provides a secure solution for workflow documentation in high-compliance environments.
